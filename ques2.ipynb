    "## Abstract Classes\n",
    "Abstract classes can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. They contain one or more abstract methods, which are just method declarations without the method implementation. These methods are then implemented by the sub-classes which inherit from these abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. The sub-class inherits the data members and the methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decorators\n",
    "Decorators are used to wrap a function, to modify its behaviour. They can be used to add functionality to an existing function.\n",
    "In the below example, the @abstractmethod decorator is used for the no_of_wheels method in Vehicle class to modify the method into an abstract method.\n",

In the below example, we can see that the Child class inherits from multiple classes namely - Father and Mother.
